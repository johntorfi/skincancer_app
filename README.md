        Deep Learning Based Web Application for Skin Cancer Classification
        
This project aimed to address the challenge of skin cancer classification through the
development of a web application utilizing deep learning techniques and Flask framework. The
study encompassed a comprehensive exploration of the field of skin cancer diagnosis,
incorporating the utilization of the Ham10000 dataset and implementing various techniques to
enhance the model's performance and accuracy.
The Ham10000 dataset, a collection of labeled skin lesion images encompassing seven distinct
skin cancer types, formed the foundation of this project. Through a meticulous analysis of the
dataset, valuable insights were gained pertaining to the distribution of skin cancer types, age,
gender, and localization, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the dataset's relevance
within the field of dermatology.
To ensure the effectiveness of the skin cancer classification model, rigorous data pre-
processing techniques were employed. Textual labels within the dataset were transformed into
numerical representations using label encoding, enabling the deep learning model to process
and interpret the data more efficiently. Moreover, the issue of imbalanced data was effectively
addressed through a combination of down-sampling and up-sampling methodologies, ensuring
a more balanced representation of different skin cancer types and consequently improving the
model's overall performance.
The developed skin cancer classification model harnessed the power of the VGG16
convolutional neural network architecture, a well-established framework known for its efficacy
in image classification tasks. By training the model on the augmented Ham10000 dataset, an
impressive accuracy of 77.13% was achieved on the test set. This exceptional accuracy level
demonstrates the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data, thereby showcasing its
potential for real-world applications and accurate skin cancer classification.The resulting web
application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images from suspicious areas,
offering accurate skin cancer classification results
